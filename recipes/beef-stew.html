    <h1>Instant Pot Beef Stew</h1>
    <img src="../images/beef-stew.jpg" height="310">
    <p>The Peruvian seco is a typical dish of the north coast and of the capital
    of the country. It is usually chicken, meat, kid, lamb, beef, chicken or
    fish, its main ingredient, and the one that gives it its characteristic
    flavor, is cilantro. It is usually accompanied by beans cooked and white
    rice.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Avocado Oil</li>
        <li>2 lbs Stewing Beef</li>
        <li>Sea Salt and Pepper</li>
        <li>1 White Onion</li>
        <li>2 Cloves of Garlic</li>
        <li>1-3 Tbsp Aji Amarillo (Optional but highly recommended)</li>
        <li>1/2 Bunch of cilantro</li>
        <li>1 Cup Beef Broth</li>
        <li>1 Cup Frozen Peas</li>
        <li>1 Tbsp Cornstarch</li>        
    </ul>

    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Pre Prep: Remove meat from fridge at least 30 minutes before
        starting to cook so it's not too cold.<br>
        In the meantime, peel and chop onion, peel and crush garlic and
        prepare "cilantro water".</li>
        <li>Cilantro Water: Add 1/2 bunch of cilantro (stems and all) to a
        blender, add beef broth and salt and pepper to taste. Amounts will
        depend on saltiness of beef broth.</li>
        <li>Brown Beef: Preheat instant pot by pressing the "sauté" button and
        wait until it says "hot". Once hot, add a splash of avocado oil and then
        brown the meat in 4-5 batches. Do NOT add all the beef at once. The
        individual pieces should not touch each other while browning. If you add
        too much meat at once it will release too much liquid and boil instead
        of brown. Add more oil as needed in between batches. Remove the browned
        beef and set aside in a bowl.</li>
        <li>Deglaze: Once all the meat is browned, add some water to the pot and
        deglaze the bottom by scrubbing off all the burnt bits and pieces with a
        wooden spatula. Then remove the inner pot and rinse and dry before
        continuing.</li>
        <li>Sofrita: Add another splash of avocado oil to the pot (still on
        sauté setting) and fry onion, garlic and ají until they start browning.
        </li>
        <li>Pressure Cook: Add browned beef and cilantro water back into the
        instant pot, put on the lid and turn the vent to the sealing position.
        Press "cancel", then "manual", make sure "high pressure" is selected and
        set the timer for 35-40 minutes (depending on the size of the beef
        cubes).</li>
        <li>Natural Pressure Release: Meat should always be depressurized
        slowly. Let the instant pot release pressure naturally. This means, you
        should not turn the valve to the venting position but rather wait until
        the safety pin drops on its own. This will take 10-20 minutes (depending
        on each individual pressure cooker).</li>
        <li>Add peas: Once the safety pin dropped, open the pot, add 1 cup
        frozen peas and let them defrost in the hot sauce for about 2-3 minutes.
        Then remove all meat and peas with a slotted spoon leaving all the
        liquid in the pot and set aside. </li>
        <li>Cilantro Sauce/Gravy: Add 1 Tbsp starch and 1 Tbsp cold water to a
        small bowl and stir vigorously until all clumps are gone. Hit "sauté"
        again on the instant pot. Add starch slurry and whisk into the liquid.
        Continue stirring until the sauce comes to a boil and cook for about 1-2
        minutes. The gravy will start to thicken fairly quickly.</li>
        <li>Serve: Serve the meat and peas over white rice and pour plenty of
        cilantro gravy over it. Garnish with freshly chopped cilantro.</li>
